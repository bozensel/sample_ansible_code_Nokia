A sample ansible code for Nokia SR devices

Ansible is a tool that generates written instructions for automating IT professionals' work throughout the entire system infrastructure.

It's designed particularly for IT professionals who use it for application deployment, configuration management, intra-service orchestration, and practically anything else a systems administrator does on a weekly or daily basis.

Ansible is simple to install because it doesn't require any agent software or other security infrastructure.

While Ansible is at the cutting edge of automation, systems administration, and DevOps, it's also valuable as a tool for devs to use in their daily work.
Ansible allows you to set up not just one machine but a complete network of them all at once, and it doesn't require any programming knowledge.
